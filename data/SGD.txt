S000145155	not in systematic sequence of S288C		FPG1	FPG1					NA	NA		NA			Putative cell wall mannoprotein involved in foam formation; contains a signal peptide and a putative GPI anchor; protein precursor homologous to Awa1p and Hpf1p
S000133140	not in systematic sequence of S288C		XDH1	XDH1		chromosome 15		15	NA	NA		NA			Xylitol dehydrogenase involved in utilization of xylose as a carbon source; not present in S288C, but located in a 65kb insertion on the right arm of chromosome XV in many wine strains such as EC1118 and AWRI1631
S000149345	not in systematic sequence of S288C		IMI1						NA	NA		NA			Protein of unknown function; in W303 strain IMI1 is encoded by one continuous open reading frame comprising of YDL037C, the intergenic region and YDL039C, while in the reference sequence of S288C, YDL037C encodes Bsc1p and YDL039C encodes Prm7p.
S000150108	not in systematic sequence of S288C		MPR2	MPR2					NA	NA		NA			L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid acetyltransferase; reduces intracellular ROS, contributes to L-proline analog resistance and tolerance to ethanol and freezing; member of N-acetyltransferase superfamily; not found in S288C, present in strains with Sigma1278b background; located on left arm of Chr X ~ 15 kb from telomere; identical to MPR1 except for one base at position 254, leading to Gly at position 85 in MPR1 and Glu in MPR2; present also in Japanese industrial bakers yeast
