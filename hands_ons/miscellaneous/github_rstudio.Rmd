```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      error = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3)
```

```{r, root, include=FALSE}
## defines the root of the project for later use
require("rprojroot") || utils::install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
```

## Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R is Case sensitive

*_Important note: R is case-sensitive, meaning that it will matter whether you use capital or lower case, keep this in mind if you get a cryptic warning or error!_*

## How to run the code in RStudio

This document contains code chunks:
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
# a code chunk begins with ```{r}
y <- rnorm(100)
x <- sum(y)
x
hist(y)
# and ends with ```
``` 

## Running your first R-code
These so called code chunks contain R code that does something: 

For example: calculate the mean of a number of random normal numbers. 
Without running the code, can you guess what the mean will approximately be?
Why is it not eaxactly 10?
```{r, results='hide'}
set.seed(12345)
random <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = 1.5)
mean(random)
hist(random, breaks = 80)
```
_*Try adjusting the `n = 100` and the `breaks` arguments, to a larger or smaller number*_

## Run the code chunks as follows:
place the cursor somewhere in a code chunk and between the 
` ```{r} ` and the ` ``` ` and press the keys: 

`Ctrl` `Shift` and `Enter` simultaneously. 

The code will run and the results will show either in the console, or below the code chunk. 

## Run a line of code as follows:

 - Place the cursor somewhere on the line that you want to run.
 - Press the keys:

`Cntrl` and `Enter` simultaneously.

You can also run a piece of code by selecting the code by dragging the cursor and left-click mouse, and entering:

`Cntrl` and `Enter` simultaneously.


## Cloud server for RStudio

 - Preinstalled version of the R-IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio
 - Runs on a remote server (SURF HPC) and has all the add-ons that are needed to run the code. 
 - Login with the credentials supplied at the beginning of the workshop. 

To login to this server:

 **https://data.innovativetesting.nl**

## RStudio interface
```{r ide, echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width=20}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(root, "images", "1a_rstudio_interface.png"))
```

## Setting up private package repositories

- Default RStudio has only enabled the CRAN repository, but there are other useful repositories that contain nice R packages. 
- Enable the Bioconductor repositories (located at http://www.bioconductor.org) as packages from these repositories are often used in molecular biology. 
- We only need to do this once, so the next time you start Rstudio it remembers which repositories are enabled. 
- Type in the Console window (not the R script window!) the following command: 

```
setRepositories(graphics=TRUE)
```

Did it work? Please let us know if not.

## About this document: Literate programming

 - This document is an R-markdown document. 
 - To create documents containing normal text, code and output of that code together. 
 - So-called _"Literate Programming"_
 - Part of the "Reproducible research" philosophy.
 - R Markdown can also include and interpret LaTeX, which is used much in the technical fields. 
 - It can render formulas as well
 - You can render RMarkdown to a number of formats (pdf, Word, Powerpoint, html)
 
## Example formula in LaTeX
 
 Working_with_R = $\sqrt[root](absolute(\frac{Participants\;fun}{much\;persistence}))$

## Where do my files live?
 
The root of a project can be defined by:
``` 
if (!require("rprojroot")) install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
root
``` 

## Be relative, be collected

 * Use relative pathays  (relative to `root`)
 * Include the `root` chunk in every script (*.Rmd, *.R) 
 * How to create paths?
 * Collect every analysis in a separate RStudio Project, preferably in an R-package
 
# Reading data into R

## Inspecting a file with a Linux Command (UBUNTU)
```{r}
system("head ./data/allijn.tsv -n40")
## this file has comments with '##'
```

## Reading data into R with the `{readr}` package
```{r}
path_data <- file.path(root, "data", "allijn.tsv")
data <- read_delim(file = path_data, 
                   delim = "\t",
                   comment = c("##"))
data %>% head(nrow = 2)
## type ?readr to get information on other functions to import data in different file formats 
```

## Creating a graph from this data to do some exploration

 * Read the comments (lines with `##`) in the file "./data/allijn.txt"
 * Discuss with your neighbour what 2 types of graphs would you want to make fist when recieving this data. 
 * Write the result of you discussion in a new .Rmd file by clicking `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown`
 * Save this file in the root of the current `surf` project 
 * You will need this for exercise 2

## Current working directory

To see what the current working directory is, you can execute the command

`getwd()` 

in the Console window. Try it now!

If all went well the final bit of the working directory will state "/surfr"

## Setting up an analysis

 - Start by creating an R script file that will contain all the steps taken to get to a certain result. 
 - Initially a scrapbook to note down what exactly you did. 
 - Annotate scripts with `# Comments`

__I use `##` for comments and `#` to disable a line of code__

 - During this workshop, we will create a special R script file (`.Rmd`) for every exercise that contains the steps of that particular exercise (for instance a file named `"exercise_github_rstudio_mystery.Rmd"`). 


## Using Git/github.com for your own work

Git/github.com are two seperate things

 * Git is the language that deals with version control of code, documents and data
 * github.com is a place to store, create, share, download and review code, packages, issues and get help

## Working with a local and a remote git repository

 1. In this exercise we will `initiate` a new git repo on www.github.com
 2. We will `clone` the remote repo to a new RStudio Project
 3. Than we will `add` some new files to our local copy of the remote repo
 4. Furthermore, we will `commmit` the changes locally \
 5. And than `push` the local changes to the remote to synchonize remote and local git repos
 
## Creating you first git **`repo`** on www.github.com

 * Go to github.com and login
 * Create a new `repository`, by clicking the green button. Call it "surf_git_demo"
 * Copy the url of this new github repo to the clipboard
 
## Initiating a local git repo in  RStudio

 * Create a `New Project` in RStudio, select the option `Version Control`
 * Copy the url from the clipboard into the `url` field
 * Let the clone finish
 
## Adding new files

 * Create a new textfile (`File` -> `New` -> `Text File`)
 * Write a few lines that indicate what this repository is all about
 * Save the file to disk under the name `README.txt`
 
## Staging files and committing 

 * Click on the `Git` pane in the upper right panel
 * Search for the `README.txt` file and click the small square in front of the file (this is called `Staging`)
 * Click the `Commit` button in the `Git` pane
 * A new view will appear, write a short message (so-called `Commit`) in the upper right text field (`Commit message`). 
 * Click the `Commit` button below the entered message
 If all goes well you will get a put up view stating [master ....] add .... and more info on the added files.

## Pushing the `local` changes to the `remote`

To synchronize the `local` changes that you just `committed` with the `remote` repo you need to `Push` the `local` changes to the `remote`. 

To do this:

 * You first always need to `Pull`, press the little blue downwards arrow to `Pull` any remote changes 
 * After `Pulling`, click the upward arrow to `Pull` 
 * Visit the remote repo
