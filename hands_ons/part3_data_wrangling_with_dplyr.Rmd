## Case Data

 * Pertussis outbreaks from The World Health Organization
 * http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/?TabID=463987
 * http://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/Pertussis%20AER.pdf
 * The data used in this presentation has been constructed from the interactive database tool hosted at: http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/ 
 * A selection was made for all available countries and all available years, for the number of cases reported to the WHO for Whooping Cough - pertussis infections.
 * The file is avaialble in `./data/CISID_pertussis_10082018.csv`
 * The values included here in the dataset are the total reported cases, per country per year.
 * At the start of the file there are remarks and metadata indicated by `#`

## Inspect the file with a system command from the `Terminal`
```{bash}
head -20 ~/surfR/data/CISID_pertussis_10082018.csv
```

## Calling Bash commands in R
```{r}
system("head -20 ~/surfR/data/CISID_pertussis_10082018.csv", 
       intern = TRUE) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

The delimeter is `,` and we indeed see the comments at the start of the file. 

## Read data
```{r, read_data}
pertussis_data <- read_csv(
  file = file.path(root, 
                  "data", 
                  "CISID_pertussis_10082018.csv"),
                           comment = "#", 
                           na = c("", " ")
  )

```

## Inspect data
```{r, inspect_data}
pertussis_data
names(pertussis_data)
```

# The pipe or "%>%"
```{r, fig.align='right', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(root, "images", "pipe.png"), dpi = 50)
```

## Pipes

 - The pipe, `%>%`, comes from the __magrittr__ package by Stefan Milton Bache
 - Load it explicitly:

```{r magrittr, message = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
```

## Using the pipe (`%>%`)

No pipe:
```
variable_new <- do_something(variable_old)
```
Pipe:
```
variable_new <- variable_old %>% 
  do_something(.)
```
or the same:
```
variable_new <- variable_old %>% 
  do_something()
```

The `.` (dot) is a placeholder for the 'old' variable. If you need to explicitely refer to something inside `variable_old` e.g. a column in dataframe you can use `.$colum_name` 

# The `{dplyr}` package in detail

_Subsetting, filtering, selecting, summarizing, sorting data(frames)_

## the {dplyr} package
The dplyr package makes data manipulation steps fast and easier:

* dplyr simplifies how you can think about common data manipulation tasks.
* Simple "verbs", functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate those thoughts into code.
* It uses efficient data storage backends, so you spend less time waiting for the computer.

## Data bases can be connected to dplyr

 * Besides in-memory data frames
 * {dplyr} also connects to out-of-memory, remote databases. 
 * By translating your R code into the appropriate SQL
 * Allows you to work with both types of data using the same set of tools.

__dplyr can work with data frames as is, but if you're dealing with large data, it's worthwhile to convert them to a `tbl_df`: this is a wrapper around a data frame that won't accidentally print a lot of data to the screen.__

## `{dplyr}` verbs

`{dplyr}` aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation:

* `select()` (and `rename()`)
* `left_join()` (`full_join()`, `anti_join()`, `right_join()`)
* `filter()` (and `slice()`)
* `arrange()`
* `distinct()`
* `mutate()` (and `transmute()`)
* `summarise()`
* `sample_n()` (and `sample_frac()`)

# Prepare the data with `{tidyr}` and `{dplyr}`

## Characteristics of the pertussis dataset

- The first few lines of the file have comments indicated with `#`
- There are 53 countries in the dataset
- There is no data for the years 1980-1989 and 2014-2018
- The data is not in `tidy` format
- Missing values are indicated with __empty cells__
- It is not a good idea to have a column name starting with a digit; why?

** Running the R-code:
```{r}
pertussis_data
```

**Discuss the output with you neighbour**

Try solving the questions:

 - Are the rows observations?
 - Are the columns variables?
 - Is there a single value in each cell?

## Tidy data
To tidy the pertussis data we need to `gather` the `year` columns. We create a long formatted dataframe containing all the years in one column, all the `annual_pertussis_cases` in another, and all the countries in a seperate column. Each combination will be repated over the new columns automatically.

```{r, eval=FALSE, error_variable_reference}
## try the code below, why does it fail?
pertussis_data_tidy <- pertussis_data %>% 
  gather(1980:2018, key = "year", value = "annual_pertussis_cases")
```

## Using ``` ` ``` 
To reference names that contain 'digits' or other 'special characters'
```{r, good_variable_reference}
pertussis_data_tidy <- pertussis_data %>% 
  gather(`1980`:`2018`, key = "year", 
                        value = "annual_pertussis_cases") %>%
  mutate(annual_pertussis_cases = as.numeric(annual_pertussis_cases
                                             ))
pertussis_data_tidy
```

# `dplyr::rename()` & `dplyr::select()`

## Renaming variables (`rename()`)
```{r}
names(pertussis_data_tidy)
## we can `rename()` a variable and `select()` variables
pertussis_data_tidy <- pertussis_data_tidy %>%
  rename(some_strange_index = X1,
       country = X2)

pertussis_data_tidy %>% head(2)
```

## Dropping the column "some_strange_index (`select()`)
```{r} 
pertussis_data_tidy <- pertussis_data_tidy %>%
  dplyr::select(country,
          year,
          annual_pertussis_cases)

pertussis_data_tidy %>% head(2)
```

## Using `-` to drop specific column(s) will also work
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
only_cases <- pertussis_data_tidy %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(country, year))

pertussis_data_tidy %>% head(2)

## When selecting multiple columns, construct a vector with `c()`
## like select(-c(columns_1, columns_2, column_3))

```

# -- INTERMEZZO -- Creating a joined table 
Before we start playing with the other `{dplyr}` verbs I would like for  you to have a more complex dataset to practice with. Here we create one joining the `gapminder` and our `pertussis` data.

## Join pertussis with gapminder data
Here we join the pertussis data with the `gapminder` data though an `inner_join()`. `{dplyr}` has many join function, which we will not go into detail here. For more information and a tutorial see:
http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html

```{r}
data("gapminder", package = "dslabs")
gapminder <- gapminder %>% as_tibble()
```

## Using `inner_join()` from `{dplyr}`
When joining tables you need at least one shared variable, that has the same name in all tables you want to join. We call this variable (or variables) the (primary) `key`s. Here we use `country` and `year` as key to join only those observations that are fully shared for both `key`s in both datasets (`inner_join`) 

```{r}
# pertussis_data_tidy
# gapminder
gapminder$year <- as.character(gapminder$year)

join <-   dplyr::inner_join (gapminder, 
                             pertussis_data_tidy, 
                             by = c("country", "year")) %>%
  na.omit()
join
```
*Now we are ready to start exploring and manipulating this dataset and maybe create some visualizations as we go along!*

# `dplyr::filter()`

## Subsetting data with `dplyr::filter()`

Filter all data for the country 'The Netherlands'
```{r}
# join$year %>% as_factor %>% levels()
# join$country %>% as_factor() %>% levels()
netherlands <- join %>%
  dplyr::filter(country == "Netherlands")
netherlands
```

# Booleans

Boolans such as `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` can be used to call multiple filter argument. You need to be explicit if you use them:

## Using booleans with `filter()`
```{r}
#join$year %>% as_factor %>% levels()
#join$country %>% as_factor() %>% levels()

booleans_demo <- join %>%
  dplyr::filter(country == "Netherlands" |
         country == "Belarus" &
         year == "1990" |                 ## | is OR in R
         year == "1995" &                 ## & is AND in R   
         !annual_pertussis_cases < 100)   ## ! is NOT in R (not smaller                                                             than 100)
booleans_demo
```

## Conditional filtering
Conditions such as:

 - `>` or `>=` (larger than, or larger or eual to), 
 - `<` or `<=` (smaller than, or smaller or equal to) 
 - `==` (equal to) 
 - `!=` (not qual to)

Can be built into a `filter()` or `select()` call as we have seen above.
Let's apply this to our dataset in more detail

## To match multiple filter statements you can use 

`%in%`

This shorthand is synonym for `match()` and takes a vector of values and a table (variable names in our case). 

Look at `?%in%` for more detail amd help

## Example for using `%in%` (match)
```{r}
numbers <- tribble(
  ~number_1, ~number_2,
  1,          2,
  3,          4,
  5,          6
)  

match_vector <- c(1,3)
numbers %>% filter(number_1 %in% match_vector)
```

## Generalized `%in%` looks like
```
values_you_want_to_match_against (variable name) %in% values_to_match (vector)
```

## **Discuss with you neighbour**
Write a filter statement using the `join` data that:

 - filters only those countries that have more than 3000 annual cases for pertussis infection. 
 - Use only data between year 1990 and 2010 
 - The resulting table must only contain the variables `year`, `country` and `annual_pertussis_cases` in that order
 - Create a plot that shows that your code has worked

```

**Please do not scroll ahead** 














 






















## **ANSWER**
```{r}
## first define the values to match against
years <- c(1990:2010) %>% as.character()
## than do the filtering using %in%
join_filtered <- join %>%
  dplyr::filter(annual_pertussis_cases > 3000 &
         year %in% years) %>%
  dplyr::select(year,
         country,
         annual_pertussis_cases)
```

## Plot
```{r}
join_filtered %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = annual_pertussis_cases)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour = country)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 1))
```

# `dplyr::arrange()`

## Sorting data with `arrange()`
 - Sort(rank) your data ascending or descending  
 - `{dplyr}` verb to use is `arrange()`, 
 - In conjunction with the `desc()` function if you want to rank in descending order 
 - `arrange()` takes one or multiple variable names for which you want to sort

## Example `arrange()`
```{r}
## ascending
join_filtered %>%
  arrange(annual_pertussis_cases)

## descending
join_filtered %>%
  arrange(desc(annual_pertussis_cases))

```
Apparently the worst `pertussis` year was 1994 in Switzerland?

# `dplyr::mutate()`

## Changing variables on the basis of a computation (`mutate()`)
Sometimes you want to change a variable by mutation e.g.:

 - Change type of the variable
 - Compute a new variable using two exisiting ones
 - Do a mathmatical transformation (e.g. `log10()` of `log2()`)
 - ... something else that mutates a variable
 
You can do two things:
 
 1) Overwrite an existing variable with the newly mutated one
 2) Add a newly mutated variable to the existing data
 
## Example `mutate()`
The annual pertussis cases is reported as an absolulte number per year. Using the population size from the `gapminder` dataset, we can calculate the number of pertussis cases per 100.000 people in a country with `mutate()`  
```{r}
join_new <- join %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(incidence = 
                  (annual_pertussis_cases/population)*100000) %>%
  select(incidence, 
         annual_pertussis_cases, 
         country, year) %>%
  arrange(desc(incidence))
join_new 
```

## Plotting the cases/100.000
```{r}
pop_size_corrected <- join_new %>%
  filter(country == "Netherlands" | country == "Norway") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = incidence)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour = country)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 1))

```

## Let's see the difference between correcting for population size or not
```{r}
pop_size_uncorrected <- join %>%
  filter(country == "Netherlands" | country == "Norway") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = annual_pertussis_cases)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour = country)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 1))
```

## Plotting two graphs in a panel
```{r}
cowplot::plot_grid(pop_size_uncorrected,
                   pop_size_corrected)
```

## **Discuss with you neighbour**

Using `dplyr::mutate()`

 - Calculate the log10 of the population in a new variable called `log10_pop`
 - Add this new variable to the `join` dataset  
 - Create a (meaningfull) plot using this new `log10_pop` variable

## **ANSWER**
```{r}
join %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(log10_pop = log10(population)) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(mean_pop = mean(log10_pop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = mean_pop)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(group = continent), method = "lm") +
  ylab("Mean population for per continent (log10)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 1))
```

## (without summarize)
````{r}
join %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(log10_pop = log10(population)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = log10_pop)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = country, shape = continent)) + 
  ylab("log 10 Population per county") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 1)) +                     theme(legend.position="none") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = continent), method = "lm")

```
 
# Summarize data with `dplyr::summarise()`

## Summary data
Summarizing data is an important step in Exploratory Data Analysis. Especially if you have high deminsional data, summarizing might lead you to interesting findings. It can also reveal or raise questions on bias in the data.

## Example `dplyr::summarise()`
```{r}
join %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_pertussis_cases = sum(annual_pertussis_cases)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as_factor(country), total_pertussis_cases),
             y = total_pertussis_cases)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Total pertussis cases from 1990 - 2013") +
  xlab("Country")
```
Reporting bias?
 
## **Discuss with your neighbour**  

Create a code chuk below that:
 
 - Groups the data by `gdp`, `continent` and `year` (use the `gapminder` dataset)
 - Calculate the total population and the total gdp for each continent and each year
 - Plot the data in a graph that shows the relationship between year, continent, total gdp per continent and total population per continent.
 
**TIP** You might want to map population-size to the size of the datapoints

## **ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION** 
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(population),
            total_gdp = sum(gdp)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year,
               y = total_gdp)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent, size = total_population))
```
 
## ONE MORE, **Discuss with you neighbour**  

**Write a code chunk below:**
 
 - Using `{ggplot2}`
 - Plot `annual_pertussis_cases` againt `infant_mortality`
 - Filter only for "Belarus" and "Netherlands"
 - Use all available data for these countries
 - Do not scroll ahead
 - What do you think is going on with this relationship?
 - Try using `colour = year` in your code
 - Try using `facet`s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
















 
## **ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION**
```{r}
names(join)
join %>%
  dplyr::filter(country == "Netherlands" |
         country == "Belarus") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = annual_pertussis_cases,
               y = infant_mortality)) +
      geom_point(aes(colour = year)) +
  facet_wrap(~ country, scales = "free")
```

## Other data sources

As well as data frames, dplyr works with data that is stored in other ways, like data tables, databases and multidimensional arrays.
